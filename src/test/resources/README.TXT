Note that precision of these tests depend on the precision of exported CSV files.
These files were exported from Matlab 2009b by `csvwrite` function.
All numerical operations were proceeded with single precission floating point.

This is basically why there is sometimes precision 1e-4 and sometimes 1e-2.
It shouldn't play any significant role with the tests.
