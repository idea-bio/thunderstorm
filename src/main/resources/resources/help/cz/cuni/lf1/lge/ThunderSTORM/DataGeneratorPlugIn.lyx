\begin_layout Section*
Generator of simulated data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ThunderSTORM is capable of generating a sequence of SMLM-like images in
 which the ground-truth positions of the molecules are known.
 This allows users to perform Monte Carlo simulations

key "Walter2010,Krizek2011"

\end_inset

 and to quantitatively evaluate the performance of applied localization
 algorithms by calculating, e.g., the Jaccard index or 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}$
\end_inset

 score using the 
\begin_inset ERT

.
 In addition to the image size and sequence length, users can specify the
 intensity, imaged size, and spatial density of the generated molecules.
 The resulting images can be subjected to sample drift.
 Noise in the generated images simulates the behavior of CCD or EMCCD cameras.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Image formation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each frame, we first create an ideal, noise free, SMLM-like image to
 simulate the expected number of photons detected in each camera pixel.
 Image formation starts by creating a list of molecules with FWHM and intensity
 chosen randomly in user-specified ranges, and with random positions of
 molecules given by a user-specified spatial density (see below).
 Users can also specify any of the implemented PSF models, including 3D
 models, to create the simulated images of molecules.
 The generated molecules are added sequentially to the final image similarly
 as in the 
\begin_inset ERT

 method.
 A user-specified offset is added to the generated image sequence to simulate
 photon background.
 Alternatively, a gray-scale image, in which each pixel value is normalized
 to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, can be used as a weighting factor of the offset level in different parts
 of the generated images to simulate an irregular background as might be
 encountered in real samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to simulate the photon counting process in the generated images,
 each pixel value expressed in photons is modified by a Poisson-distributed
 random number.
 The data generator can optionally simulate EM gain of EMCCD cameras.
 In this case we use a stochastic model described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hirsch2013"

\end_inset

, where the electron multiplication is modeled by the Gamma distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(k,g)$
\end_inset

.
 The shape 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is given by the number of photons detected in the simulated CCD register
 and the scale 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is given by the user-specified value of gain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the signal in the camera register is digitized by converting the
 photons to digital counts.
 The CCD sensitivity (in photons per A/D count), and the camera digitizer
 offset (in A/D counts) are user-specified in the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
href{CameraSetupPlugIn.html}{camera setup}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, as well as the camera pixel size (in nanometers) as projected to the sample
 plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Fixed or spatially varying density of molecules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users can specify a fixed or spatially varying density of simulated molecules
 in the generated images.
 The variability is achieved by a user-supplied gray-scale mask 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, in which each pixel value is normalized to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 and used to represent the weighting factor.
 The average number of molecules at a given integer pixel position 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 is then computed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{d}\left(x,y\right)=a^{2}M\left(x,y\right)d_{\mathrm{max}}\,,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the camera pixel size as projected to the sample plane, and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mathrm{max}}$
\end_inset

 is the maximum spatial density of molecules per unit area as specified
 by users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure for generating molecular positions follows the spatial Poisson
 point process 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kendall1979"

\end_inset

.
 Thus for each value 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{d}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

, a random number of events (molecules) is created in the pixel 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 using a Poisson random number generator.
 Molecular centers are placed uniformly and randomly within that pixel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the mask 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 should be at least the same size as the desired super-resolution image
 in order to preserve high resolution in the final reconstruction.
 The coordinates of the molecular centers are down-scaled appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Additional sample drift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generated molecular positions in the image sequence can be subjected
 to a lateral sample drift.
 Users need to specify the speed and direction of the drift, which is constant
 throughout the image sequence.
